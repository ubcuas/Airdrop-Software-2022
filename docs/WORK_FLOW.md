## Issue and Project Tracking

We will use issue to track our features and bugs. Here is a list of the tag we will use for each issue:

| tag name              | priority | meaning                                                      |
| --------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Bug                   | High     | any problems that cause compilation error or logic error that need to be instantly fixed should be tagged with bug. This could be a feature that needs to be fixed, or need to be added to make the system work again. |
| Testing               | High     |                                                              |
| Feature               | Medium   | features are usually modules that we would like to add to the systems. |
| Maintenance           | Medium   | "features" that we would like to revisit/rewrite.            |
| Design                | Medium   |                                                              |
| CI/CD                 | Low      |                                                              |
| Cleaning/Optimization | Low      | features" that we would like to remove/optimize.             |
| Misc                  | Low      | none technical items such as formatting, documentation edit etc. |
